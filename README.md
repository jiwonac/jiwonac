Hello ðŸ‘‹ I am Jiwon Chang. I have a B.S. in computer science at the University of Rochester and have now joined URCS as a PhD candidate under professor Fatemeh Nargesian. I study data management for AI/ML, especially within data lake and coreset contexts. 

My [personal website](https://jiwonc.net/) is the home for all relevant information.
