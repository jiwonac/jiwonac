Hello ðŸ‘‹ I am Jiwon Chang. I have a B.S. in computer science at the University of Rochester and have now joined URCS as a PhD candidate under professor Fatemeh Nargesian. 

I research topics related to:
 - Data acquisition for improving ML performance. 
 - Integrating ML inference into analytical DBMS. 
 - Data systems for auditing ML behavior. 

My [personal website](https://jiwonc.net/) is the home for all relevant information.
